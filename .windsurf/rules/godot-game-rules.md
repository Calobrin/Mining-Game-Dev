# All code/script used is for Godot 4.3, ONLY use code that is supported in 4.3 and not any sort of older code that has been replaced. (So use syntax that is meant to be 4.3)

# NEVER create duplicate code methods. Always check to see what we have before making a new one.
Ensure code is always clean, consice, effecient, and maintainable.
